## Overview

This is my implementation for [Social Link Profile clallenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Again, have right sizes for the elements was crucial, all of them were measured with a ruler because if I base it on the Figma file, it does not turn out the same
